category: the essence of composition

category theory is more epistemology than ontology
the similar structure we see reflected everywhere says more
about our minds than outward nature

computers can help us solve nontrivial problems

id :: a -> a
id x = x

type variable a
any type has id arrow to self

category theory, maximally abstract:
objects and arrows between them

however, objects exist only to mark the ends of arrows
